Requesting a new trip will post the trip to the trips API.

An agent can approve a trip by typing in its ID number.


## Project Overview

  In this project I successfully made HTTPS requests to access and manipulate the data in an API. I used multiple array prototype methods to organize and alter that data, based on interaction with a user interface.
